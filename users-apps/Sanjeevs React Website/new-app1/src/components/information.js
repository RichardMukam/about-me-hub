            <h2><u>Freshman Computer Science</u></h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Sanjeev Devarajan, a freshman at the University of Maryland 
                studying computer science. I'm originally from Chicago, IL, so UMD was
                definitely a big change of environment being in the east coast. The one
                thing I can say for sure is I definitely don't miss Chicago winters! I'm
                currently a part of Hack4Impact, and the Smith Investment Fund, two clubs
                that I'm really enjoying my time being a part of.
