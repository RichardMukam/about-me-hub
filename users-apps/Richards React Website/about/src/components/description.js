                Hi, welcome to my page! My name is Richard Mukam Jr, and I'm currently a freshman studying computer science at 
                the <a id="umd" href="https://cs.umd.edu" target="_blank">University of Maryland, College Park</a>. 
                My current interests are front-end development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. 
                I'm currently a member of a student organization called <a id="h4i" href="https://umd.hack4impact.org" 
                target="_blank">Hack4Impact</a>, a student-led organization where students are given the opportunity to leave 
                a lasting impact on society by partnering with organizations and building software they'll be able to use to 
                better their duties. I'm particularly psyched for tasks I'll have while a part of Hack4Impact because I get to 
                improve my front-end development skills while leaving an impact on society! At this moment in time, that's the 
                best of both worlds for me. But anyways, I love to workout, play basketball (just about any sport really though), 
                and something odd: I love math!
